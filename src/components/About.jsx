            The Department of Computer Science, University of Karachi, was
            established by a resolution of Academic Council in its meeting held
            on November 27, 1984, and it began functioning in the academic year
            1985-86 by offering a Degree Program in Master of Computer Science
            (MCS) — becoming one of the first institutions in Karachi imparting
            education in Computer Science and Technology. The Department also
            offers an evening program leading to a Post Graduate Diploma (PGD) in
            Computer & Information Sciences. In 1995, the Department started the
            MCS evening program on a self-finance basis to cater to the growing
            demand for professionally skilled manpower in Computer Science.

            To further strengthen the discipline of Computer Science by producing
            high-quality professionals with sound fundamental knowledge, the
            Department launched the BS (Computer Science) program in 1996 and
            2001 — a four-year degree leading to the MS (Computer Science), a
            two-year program after completing the BS. The MS program leads to the
            PhD (Computer Science) program. The University of Karachi has
            excellent supporting faculty in Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, and
            other allied subjects for teaching BS (Computer Science) courses. The
            first batch of the BS morning program graduated in 1999.
